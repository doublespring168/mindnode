* Covert Org to opml

** You need to know
    This file is coming from [[https://github.com/semk/Org2OPML][semk/Org2OPML]], but I add a feature for it that we can add a notes for a node.

    I think this feature is really important and useful for me.

** What to do
    Create a Mindnode from org file.
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
    [[file:./imgs/20180429_220719_29803piz.png]]

    We can look up the node popover:
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
    [[file:./imgs/20180429_222055_29803bsC.png]]

** Usage
    Run the command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    # export test.opml
    python3 org2opml.py test.org
    #+END_SRC

    and then we import *test.opml* to [[https://mindnode.com/][MindNode]].
